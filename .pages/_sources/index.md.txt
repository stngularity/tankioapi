# Welcome!
**tankioapi** is a [Python](https://python.org) written wrapper for the
[**Tanki Online**](https://tankionline.com/) game API. The module itself is needed to
get the top of players, get information about the player separately, etc. If You know
more functionality of the API of the game **Tanki Online**, then please report this
functionality in the [`Issues`](https://github.com/stngularity/tankioapi/issues).

itself changes, but not immediately. Well, if You want to support this project, You
can give it a star.
